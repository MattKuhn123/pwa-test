# PWA Test

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.1.

The purpose is to tinker with how Angular implements PWAs and see how service workers behave, learn about the who/what/when/where/why of caching.

## Application context

In any demonstration, it helps to give a context/setting/domain that the demo is working in.

This application is for biologists to record the population data of wild life in the Ohio river valley.
